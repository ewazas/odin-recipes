    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I work at a coffee shop and my favorite coffee drink is a caramel macchiato so I created a caramel macchiato cheesecake that has become my favorite cheesecake.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup brewed espresso or strong coffee</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>pressurized whipped cream</li>
        <li>caramel ice cream topping2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Mix together the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 2 tablespoons of sugar until well combined. Press into the bottom of the prepared springform pan, and 1 inch up the sides. Bake in preheated oven for 8 minutes, then remove to cool on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat the softened cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Gradually add 1 cup of sugar, beating until blended. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in sour cream, espresso and vanilla. Pour batter into the baked and cooled crust.</li>
        <li>Bake cheesecake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 5 minutes; then turn the oven off, partially open the door and allow the cheesecake to rest for 15 minutes more. Remove from the oven, and run a knife around the edges. Cool cheesecake on a wire rack to room temperature, then cover the springform pan with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for 8 hours.</li>
        <li>To serve, cut the cheesecake into wedges and garnish each slice with whipped cream and caramel sauce.</li>
    </ol>
